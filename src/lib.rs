//! The planet is never stored in full: terrain is a pure function of
//! `(seed, position)`. Servers persist only *deltas* made by players and the
//! simulation; clients regenerate the base terrain locally.
//!
//! Geometry: a cube projected onto a sphere (cube-sphere). Each of the six
//! faces is a quadtree, which gives natural level-of-detail tiles.
